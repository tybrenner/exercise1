				  <h2>My Goals For This Class</h2>
				  	<p>I want to gain the knowledge and skills needed for a career relating to coding. I am taking the Web Foundations series to start out, and I plan on taking Javascript Immerssion class if it all works out.</p>
				 </article>
				<article>
				  <h2>Concerns</h2>
				  	<p>My main concern is not knowing if I can commit to coding long enough to keep up with others or new languages. However, this class always leaves me eager to work on assignments and to keep learning, so it does not seem like it will be an issue.</p>

				  	<p>Another concern I have has to do with my chances of getting a job after going through this course and the Javascript Immersion. I am concerned about this because I have not finished college and I only have a part time job, so I am wondering if my job experience or education play as big of a role as the actual skills I gain from PCS.</p>

				  	<p>I have less than average knowledge and a large interest in anything computer related, so the last concern I have with this class is all the different languages I may or may not have to learn. After I take the Javascript Immersion class, I have no idea where to go from there, whether it be to continue my education or to look for a career after the Javascript Immersion class.</p>

				  <h2>Every card has a title</h2>
				  <p>
				    This card has a <b>paragraph</b> of <span id="redText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.google.com">link</a>. It also has a <i>second</i>

				    <span id="blueText"> sentence </span> of text with a <a href="http://portlandcodeschool.com">link</a>
				  </p></article>
				<article>
				  <h2>Every card has a width</h2>
				  	<p><b>But</b> we never use pixels ("px") to determine the size of a card.
				 	</p>

				  	<p>
				    We use measurements that <i>flex,</i> like percents (%), or that relate to the size of the content, like root <i>"em"</i> unites (rem), which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.
				  	</p>
				  	</article>

				  <h2>
				    <p>This card has lists</p>
				  </h2>
				  <p> Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
				  </p>
				  <p>
				    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com">go here</a></li>
				    <li><a href="http://twitter.com">go there</a></li>
				    <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com">go someplace else</a></li>
				  </p>

				  <p>
				    My favorite colours:
				  </p>
				  <p>
				    <li> <span id="redText2">red</span></li>
				    <li><span id="brownText">brown</span></li>
				    <li><span id="greenText">green</span></li>

				    This card collects terms and their definitions into Descrition List Element (dl) for later reference.
